## 🛠️ Setup & Deployment

### **Prerequisites**
- Google Gemini API key ([Get one here](https://ai.google.dev))
- Cloudflare account (free tier works)

### **Deploy the Backend**
```bash
1. Create Cloudflare Worker
npm create cloudflare@latest securecode-worker
cd securecode-worker

2. Add the worker code from this repository
3. Set your Gemini API key
npx wrangler secret put GEMINI_API_KEY

4. Deploy
npx wrangler deploy
Deploy the Frontend

Import this repository to Lovable
Update the API endpoint in the code
Deploy to Vercel/Netlify via Lovable's export feature

Environment Variables
envGEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
ALLOWED_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend-domain.com  # Optional
```

##🔒 Security & Privacy

No Code Storage: Code is analyzed in real-time and immediately discarded
API Key Security: Your Gemini API key is stored securely in Cloudflare Workers
No Logging: Code content is never logged or stored
